# Data-Analysis

This project aims to provide students of Pandas, Numpy and Maptplotlib the basic tools these packages provide to conduct effective data analysis of datasets.

The dataset used in this tutorial was obtained from [Sahil Tailor's Kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahiltailor/mens-t20-world-cup-ball-by-ball-dataset).
